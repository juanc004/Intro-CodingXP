## Introduction to Solidity

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Think of smart contracts as self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are directly written into lines of code.

## Why Learn Solidity?

- Blockchain Development: Solidity is essential for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.
- Career Opportunities: Blockchain developers are in high demand.
- Innovation: Create innovative solutions in finance, supply chain, gaming, and more.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To get started with Solidity, set up your development environment:

1. Install MetaMask: MetaMask
2. Use Remix IDE: Remix IDE

## Solidity Basics

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They run on the blockchain and are immutable.

### Basic Syntax
- Comments: Use // for single-line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.
- Version Pragma: Specifies the Solidity version to use.
  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
  ```

### Data Types
- Boolean: `bool`
- Integer: `int`, `uint`
- Address: `address`
- String: `string`
- Bytes: `byte`

### Variables
- State Variables: Stored on the blockchain.
- Local Variables: Temporary, only within functions.

### Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be called to perform a specific task.
```solidity
function getData() public view returns (uint) {
  return storedData;
}
```

## Core Solidity Concepts
### State Variables and Functions
State variables are written to the blockchain, and functions define contract behavior.

### Visibility
- Public: Accessible by anyone.
- Private: Accessible only within the contract.
- Internal: Accessible within the contract and derived contracts.
- External: Accessible only from other contracts and transactions.

### Modifiers
Modifiers change the behavior of functions.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
    _;
}
```

### Events
Events are used to log information.

```solidity
event DataStored(uint data);
```

### Mappings
Mappings store key-value pairs.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
```
